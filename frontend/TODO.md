# TODO List for frontend side

- Fix validation collapsing
    - Keep a temporary copy of the phone on the frontend to modify, and only actually modify the phone in the Tauri app when switching between phones.
    - And/Or just make a Confirm button? I prefer the switching method, but might not make programmatic sense
